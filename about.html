        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>With a strong background in technology consulting, sales, and customer service, I have developed a passion for problem-solving, communication, and helping others find the right solutions. Currently working as a Technology Consultant at Verizon, I assist customers in navigating complex technology options, troubleshoot device issues, and ensure they have the best products to meet their needs. This role has strengthened my ability to analyze problems, provide clear solutions, and work collaboratively in a fast-paced environment. Previously, I worked as a Sales Consultant at EOS Fitness, where I conducted fitness assessments, helped customers reach their fitness goals, and was promoted to Assistant General Manager. My experience also includes inside sales at Flex Energy, LLC, where I honed my skills in CRM platforms, lead generation, and customer relationship management. My diverse background has built a strong foundation in technology, sales strategy, and customer engagement, and I am eager to apply these skills in the world of web development and software engineering. With a passion for learning and growth, I am currently expanding my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic, user-friendly web experiences.</p>
